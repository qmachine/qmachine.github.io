qmachine.github.io
==================

This repository contains the static resources for
[qmachine.github.io](//qmachine.github.io), the project page for
[QMachine](https://www.qmachine.org). If I could get (piggyback?) SSL working
with CloudFlare and GitHub's custom domain names, I would use this repository
to deploy QM's homepage, but right now it's just a test page.
